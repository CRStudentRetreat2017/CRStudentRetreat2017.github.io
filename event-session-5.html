To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science.</q><br> - <i>A. Einstein (1938)</i></blockquote>
		<blockquote> <q>What I cannot create, I do not understand.</q><br> - <i>R. Feynman (1988)</i></blockquote> <br>
			In this session, we explore the links between science and creativity. We do not only discuss how science can influence art (and vice versa), but also look at creative ideas
			on how to communicate and visualize (our) science to the research community in specific, as well as the general public at large.<br>
