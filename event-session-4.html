<div class="event-info">
    <div> <p>During the last year a lot of new people has entered
        the Champalimaud Research Community. We believe that is
        important to establish a cooperative and healthy working
        environment so, this activity will allow the students to
        get to know each other, not only in a working level (knowing our projects)
        but in a personal level. Being comfortable and feeling able to trust those
        around you is very beneficial when developing our own projects and maintaining
        our mental health during the process.
