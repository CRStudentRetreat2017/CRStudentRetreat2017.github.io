	<div> <p>Open Science is a movement to make science, and as such scientific data,
			results and discussion more accessible to other scientists as well as
			the public. We have invited two brilliant and inspiring people, André and Maria, to talk about
			their perspective on Open Science. After their talks, we will have several interactive
			tables to induce discussions and actions on how to improve Open Science at the
			Champalimaud Research. <br>
