            The idea is that we will discuss things we like and don't like about the program
            and what we students need in order to be happy and productive. This session is not
            intended to be a solution session where we solve all of our problems and grievances,
            but rather the start of a new dialogue concerning the program and where we would like
            to see it in the future. This is one of the few times of the year that almost all of
            the students get together, so it is a perfect time to discuss. The format will be kind
            of like a town hall meeting and it will not be super formal, but we need people to participate!
            If anyone has any topics they would like to discuss, please send them to us.
