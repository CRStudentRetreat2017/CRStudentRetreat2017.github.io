To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science.</q><br> - <i>A. Einstein (1938)</i></blockquote>
		<blockquote> <q>What I cannot create, I do not understand.</q><br> - <i>R. Feynman (1988)</i></blockquote> <br>
			In this session, we explore the links between science and creativity. We do not only discuss how science can influence art (and vice versa), but also look at creative ideas
			on how to communicate and visualize (our) science to the research community in specific, as well as the general public at large.<br><br>

					<ul  style="list-style: none;">
						<li> a) <b>Animation Design for Game Development and Digital Art</b> (Diogo):<br>
						 	<blockquote>My table will show you the basics of some animation techniques
								and has the goal of helping you create an animated game sprite (character,
								spaceship, potato, etc.). If we have time we can also talk about more
								science-oriented subjects, but still with a digital art/animation background.
								For example, how to create a motion graphic abstract.</blockquote></li>
						<li> b) <b>Game development in Science</b> (Pietro): <br>
							<blockquote>In this workshop, we'll see how videogames can help science.
								I'll show a prototype of a 2D space-shooting game I'm developing to
								study confidence in decision making under uncertainty. We'll take
								this game as a starting point to understand possibilities and limitations
								of videogames as a tool in experimental psychology. The focus will be on two
								complementary aspects of games in research: What are the guiding
								principles to design a game that is both entertaining and insightful in terms
								of probing the decision process of the player? How does one code a game
								(using the <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot game engine</a>)?
						</blockquote></li>
						<li> c) <b>Collaborative Data Analysis</b> (Danbee, Gonçalo L.):<br>
							<blockquote>We will provide github pages tutorials for setting up an online lab notebook,
							and demo several varieties of scientific documentation. We will also share several
							open datasets and collaboratively set-up a theoretical framing and analytical workflow
							for digesting those datasets.</blockquote></li>
						<li> d) <b>Generative art</b> (Dennis, Gonçalo G.):
							<blockquote>
								We are exploring simple models of biological phenomena that are able to generate
								surprising patterns and motives. Specifically, we will use the <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing framework</a>
								as an easy coding environment to create art. We provide examples and tutorials that
								will guide you to create your own sketches and digital designs. Therefore, it offers
								you an easy entrance to the world of programming together with the freedom of
								individual artistic expression.
						</blockquote>
						 </li>
						<li> e) <b>Science &amp; Performance</b> (Sam Meyler)
							<blockquote>Inspired loosely by Peter Brook’s ‘The Empty Space’,
								we will wear and explore a range of ambiguous masks and see
								how they create different inference spaces for the observer.
								How do we allow for character idiosyncrasies to emerge? The
								workshop will involve very simple theatre exercises and games
								in a fun and safe environment, and end (if time allows) with a
								discussion on biological motion and observational social learning. </blockquote>
						</li>
						<li> f) <b>Interactive surfaces</b> (João, Mauricio)
                            <blockquote> In social contexts different levels of the environment or subjects actions synchronize and interact.
                                The idea of this table is to explore ways of visualizing this interactions by means of a continuous sampling
                                of some movements made by many subjects with respect to a background rhythm that they will be using to coordinate
                                their individual movements. Using Bonsai and TUNAs we will explore video mapping using the relations between music
                                and movements, and we hope that  this project will lead to a visualization for the retreat party. </blockquote>
