										<h4>Christa Rhiner</h4>
										<p style="font-size:10pt;">Dr. Rhiner received her Master degree from the University of Bern, after having performed her Master
											project in the lab of Adriano Aguzzi at the University Hospital in Zurich. Together with a friend,
											Christa also had her own company importing textiles of the Airchair (she recommends to buy some
											for the Champalimaud since they are really comfortable) who financed her studies. Then, she entered
											the International Neuroscience PhD program of the ETH/University of Zurich (UZH) and joined the lab
											of Dr. Michael O. Hengartner at the Institute of Molecular Life Sciences for studies on nervous system
											development and axon guidance in C. elegans. During this time, she also acquired a degree in science
											communication from the UZH and Institute for Applied Media Studies in Winterthur. Then she got a
											postdoctoral fellow in the group of Dr. Eduardo Moreno at the National Cancer Center (CNIO) in Madrid,
											where she identified and characterized key genes mediating cell competition in Drosophila and mice.
											In 2011, Dr. Rhiner became a lecturer and investigator at the IZB in Bern, Switzerland, where she
											worked on neuronal selection and began to study regenerative neurogenesis in Drosophila. In 2016,
											she moved to Portugal to start her own group at the Champalimaud Center in Lisbon focusing on stem
											cell control and regeneration.</p>

										<h4>Christian Machens</h4>
										<p>Christian did his PhD in computational neuroscience with Andreas Herz at the Humboldt-University in Berlin.
											In 2002, he moved to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory where he worked as a postdoctoral fellow with Tony Zador and Carlos Brody.
											After a brief stint as a junior research group leader at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich during the year 2006/2007,
											he was appointed Assistant Professor at the Ecole normale supérieure in Paris in 2007 where he joined the Group for Neural Theory.
											Since 2011, Christian is a full-time faculty member at Champalimaud Research leading the Theoretical Neuroscience Lab.</p>

										<h4>Silvia Schwartz</h4>
										<p style="font-size:11pt;">Silvia did her Master thesis in Rome on the behaviour of mice housed in space,
											on the international space station (How cool is that!), then she went to the
											friendly New Zealand, where she did her PhD on the molecular pathways underlying
											long-term memory formation in flies. It was here that she learned that Sundays
											are not made for working, because during her second year of PhD, she was working
											on a Sunday afternoon and went into the Head of the Faculty lab to refill the 5
											litres water tank... she obviously forgot it there and basically flooded a lab,
											and was risking to flood the lab below, which was the microscopy facility...
											Well not funny at that moment, she was traumatised and the funny thing is that
											people seem to be amused by it! But no harm done.  Currently she is doing a
											Postdoc in Rhiner Lab where she is investigating the molecular pathways that
											underpins damage-responsive neural stem cells in flies. She will now give us
											some insights on her experience.</p>

										<h4>Dennis Eckmeier</h4>
										<p style="font-size:11pt;">Dennis lifelong dream was to become a paleontologist, but once he faced
											the fact that it was more about rocks than dinosaurs, he went to the red
											cross for a year to and then studied Biology in Marburg. He moved from a
											rather traumatic undergrad thesis on frog courtship together with a mild
											World of Warcraft addiction to work on zebra finch flight navigation in
											Bielefeld University. Dennis claims that  his PhD was “the best time” he
											had in academia, but he still faced several burn out in the middle of it.
											He has been a postdoc for almost 7 years in Carey Lab and he learned a lot
											about “advisers” and how to get your great career start completely fucked
											up by bad decisions. So, we will now share with us those experiments,
											warnings and tips on what worked best. </p>

										<h4>Thiago Carvalho</h4>

                                                                                Birmingham as an Irvington Institute fellow, working on B cells with John Kearney.
                                                                                Four years later, I returned to Portugal to be the associate curator for the

											behaviour, are as fun as the ones I grew up with. I am currently working on my master thesis
											exactly on this topic. My hobbies are to study philosophy of the mind, playing video games,
											producing music and playing the drums and, (albeit terrible at it) playing basketball. </p>
