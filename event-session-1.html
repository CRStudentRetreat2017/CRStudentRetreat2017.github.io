    <div> <p> Doing a PhD has always been seen as a long and lonely business
        since the early 19th century when the idea of the postgraduate research
        doctorate was first formally recognised at Humboldt University, Germany.
        It is probably the toughest test anyone can face in academic life. We
        have invited several people who already went through a PhD so they could
        share their experience (good and bad things) and also give us some tips
        that can help to improve our own experience.  <br>
